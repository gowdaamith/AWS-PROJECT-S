Step 1: Enable the EBS Snapshots
-------------------------------------
First you will be give with tree option's:
- Start with a template          ---->  AWS configured template
- Build a new plan               ---->  You configure everything  
- Define a plan using JSON       ---->  Define plan using Json 

Backup plan name: [EX: ebs-daily-backup-7days ]

Backup rule Configuration : 
 Backup rule name = backup-rule-volume-retention

 Backup vault: Defaul  
 Logically air-gapped vault[optional]
   - features 
      - Cannot be deleteed easily 
      - Protected from ransomeware
      - Even root user can't instantly delete backkup's
  Used in production 
  

 Backup Frequency (When the backup run)
----------------------------------------------
*Daily [backup runs daily  and Incremental for EBS]
other options are : 
*Hourly 
*Weekly
*Monthly 


Backup window 
------------------------------------------------
*Start time
-Back start time   
*Start within 
- if the backup doesn't start at start  time it must be restarted within the start within time from the start time
*Complete within 
-Backing up must finish within this day (useful for the very large instances)

Poin-in time recovery [ continuous change recording ,not periodic snapshots  ]
   This means : Instead of taking backup once per day AWS records every changes as it happen 
               Internally : first it will take the backup of the entire thing then it will  update the backup with every update 
               So the if we want to go back in the time ,we can do 


Lifecyle : 
Cold storage : 
-Move old backups to  cheaper storage 
- The requirement must atleast should be 90 days  not supported for all ther sevices

If you choose the cold storage you have the option to choose for how much time the backup will stay in the warm volume

Total retenttion Period : for how much time the  backup should be kept 

Backup Indexes: [optional ]
- Only for the EBS/S3 indexes
- Allow for faster search and metadata Queries 

Copy to the destination : 
- This is used for the diaster management   and allow you to make a copy of  your current backup to a another location 

Malware protection: [ you can also enable or disable the malware protection ]

Application-consistent backup
Enable application-consistent snapshots for applications that support VSS. Prerequisites required. Prerequisites required. 
Windows VSS [Enable or disable ]
 - This prevent the application form  writing into the volme while taking the snapshot 

 S3 backup setting : 
 - backup  ACL's
 - Back up objects tags

 These all the thing you should configure int the AWS  backup
