The problem that we are looking up today  and trying to solve is :

Upto today ,while setting up  the instance we would follow these steps like : 
1.Launch the Ec2
2.SSH into it 
3.install nginx / packages
4.configure the things manually 

Now the problem is :
1.What if this EC2 dies
2.What if i need 10 identical EC2's  
3.Do i want to repeat these commands every time?

The answer is NO

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Here we are going to create a Ec2 image that already contain your setup ,so every new Ec2 is ready immediately 

What is AMI?
---------------------------
A AMI is  just :
*A saved copy of your EC2'S disk
*Including :
  - OS
  - Installed software
  - Config files

Think of it like a: 
- Taking a  full backup of a configured system and reusing it

When you click Create Image:
1.AWS takes a snapshot of the root volume 
2.Register it as an AMI
3.That AMI can now launch new EC2
