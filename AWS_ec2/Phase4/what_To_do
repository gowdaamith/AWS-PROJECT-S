STEP 1: Launch a normal Ec2 instance
--------------------------------------

STEP 2: Configure it once
-------------------------------------
Inside the Ec2 run the following commands
>> sudo apt update
>> sudo apt install -y nginx
>> echo "<h1> Phase 4 Golden AMI </h1> | sudo tee /var/www/html/index.html
>> sudo systemctl enable nginx

Verify it using : 
>> curl localhost

Step 3: Create AMI form this Ec2:
---------------------------------------
Console path : 

Go to the console -> Search for the Instances in the search bar -> Select the instance 
->  Actions -> Image and templates ->Create a image

When you specify the things and click on  create image the following things happen:
1.Ec2 instance reboots ,means everything stops writing to disk 
2.AWS takes a backup of the disk ,your root volume ,OS ,apps,configs,files ,this backup is callled as snapshot 
3.All the EBS volume attached to the instaces are included by default and AWS alos include them and take the  snapshot 
4.AMI points to that snapshot
5.Now you can use this to create a new ec2 or a server similar to this


Wait until the AMI status = available

Step 4: Lauch a new Ec2 using this AMI 
-----------------------------------------
While launching : 
*Choose MY AMIs
*Select "AMI THAT YOU HAVE JUST CREATE"e
*NO user data
*No manual setup 

Step 5: Test the new Ec2
----------------------------------------
SSH into it and run:
>> curl localhost 
If you see : 
>> Phase 4 works 

The everything works
