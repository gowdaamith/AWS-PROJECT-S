The difference b/w the AMI[images] and Templates
-------------------------------------------------

AMI -> A saved copy of the sever's disk and software 
Contains : 
*Operating system
*Installed apps
*Config files
*Files on disk 

Purpose: 
*Recreate the same server setup  
*backup and cloning 

Template :-> a set of rules that tells AWS how to create an Ec2 instance

contains : 
*Which AMI to use 
*instance type
*Key pair
*Security group
*Network setting 
*User -data (startup scripts)

Purpose : 
*Standardize how the instance should be launched
*Avoid manual configuratioon each time 

use the command to check where the instance configuratioon like a website is reachable or not by using :
>> curl localhost

if you add storage agian in the storage section while creating the ec2 from the ami this will add up to the 
ami strage for example [ 8+ 8] .But you should format it  to use it
