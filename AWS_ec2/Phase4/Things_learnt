The difference b/w the AMI[images] and Templates
-------------------------------------------------

AMI -> A saved copy of the sever's disk and software 
Contains : 
*Operating system
*Installed apps
*Config files
*Files on disk 

Purpose: 
*Recreate the same server setup  
*backup and cloning 

Template :-> a set of rules that tells AWS how to create an Ec2 instance

contains : 
*Which AMI to use 
*instance type
*Key pair
*Security group
*Network setting 
*User -data (startup scripts)

Purpose : 
*Standardize how the instance should be launched
*Avoid manual configuratioon each time 

use the command to check where the instance configuratioon like a website is reachable or not by using :
>> curl localhost

while creating an instance from the AMI in the storage section the volume must be same  ro more than the volume 
of the snapshot .if its small then instance creation will be not possible if its large then the current filesystem 
will expand to that volume 


Scenario recap
AMI snapshot size = 8 GB
You set root volume size = 10 GB

What you get
Final root volume size = 10 GB
Snapshot data is restored inside that 10 GB

Not added on top

❌ 8 GB + 10 GB = 18 GB → does NOT happen
