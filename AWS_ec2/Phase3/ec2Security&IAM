Goal:
Secure EC2 access and allow EC2 to talk to AWS services without access keys.

What You’ll Learn in Phase 3
By the end, you’ll understand:

*Why IAM roles are better than access keys
*How EC2 securely talks to AWS services
*What Instance Metadata Service (IMDS) is
*Security Groups vs NACLs
*How to harden SSH access

Here we are going to do :
1.Create an IAM Role for EC2
2.Attach IAM Role to EC2
3.Test the IAM Role
4.Understand Instance Metadata
5.Enforce IMDSv2(Security Hardening)
6.Security Group Harding 
7.Disable Password login
