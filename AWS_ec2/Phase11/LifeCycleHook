Goal: 
Pause the newly launched instance before it start serving traffic ,so you can : 
*installs software 
*run script 
*wait for dependencies 
*then allow it into sevice 


This happens inside the ASG  ,not manually 

With Lifecycle Hook : 
ASG launches instance
→ Instance = Pending:Wait  ⏸️
→ (You do setup / bootstrap)
→ You signal "continue"
→ Instance = InService ✅
