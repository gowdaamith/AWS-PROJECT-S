Warm Pool Instances??

A WARM POOL  instances is a set of pre-launched  Ec2 Instances that are NOT serving traffic ,but are ready to be used 
instantly 
    "Think of it as a Instances waiting on the bench ,already warmed up to sever the traffic"


Why WARM POOL instances exits??
Normally ,when ASG  scales out :
Launch EC2 (1–2 min)
OS boots
User data runs
App starts
Health checks pass
Instance becomes InService

⏱️ Total: 3–10 minutes


What Warm Pool fixes ??
With a warm pool: 
Instances are already created
OS is already booted
App may already be installed
Only final steps are needed

⏱️ Scale-out time: seconds


Warm Poool  configuration :

Warm pool state :   
There will be three state : 
-Running 
-Stopped 
-Hibernate 

Minimum instances :    [ Always keep atleast this many instances ready 
                         Even if no scaling happens  ASG will keep 1 warm instance ]

Instance reuse on Scalne in:

When ASG scales IN
Instead of terminating instance
It moves it into Warm Pool


Warm Pool Size :
Default specification :
Warm Pool Size = Max capacity - Desired capacity 

Custom Specification : 
Warm Pool Size = Custom number  - Desired capacity   [ never let the warm pool size go below it ]
