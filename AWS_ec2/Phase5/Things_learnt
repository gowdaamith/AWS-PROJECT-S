Launch template
----------------------
A launch template is a reusable  blueprint that defines how to launch an Ec2 instance 
It contains all the configuration details needed to start the Ec2 ,except the actual  subnet/ Az

A launch template will contain: 
*AMI ID
*Instance  type 
*Key pair
*Network configuration will be given later during the creation of the instance
*Storage can be spcecified and the instance created will come with this volume unless we add them additionally 

Auto scaling group will use the launch template to create instance automatically 

Application load balancer 
--------------------------
ALB is an AWS managed service that distribute incoming traffic to multiple EC2 instances 
It sits in front of your service and routes requests intelligently 


Why we need it : 
Because   if you have multiple Ec2 instance ,you don't want user to : 
*directly connect to each Ec2
*Manage IP'S manually 
*Lose services when one instane fails 

ALB solves all of this

Key features :
*Load balancing  -> it distribute the traffic among all the ec2 so that it wil not be a burden on one ec2
*High availability -> alb works across multiple availability zones
*Health check's -> it automatically checks wheather the instance is healthy to receive the data or not 
*Path based routing ->  ALB allows path based routing 
Ex: 
/api -> Ec2 group 1
/blog -> Ec2 group 2

This  is usefull for microservices 
*HTTPS / SSL termination
