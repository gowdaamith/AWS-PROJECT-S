PHASE 2: EBS (Elastic Block Store) – Deep Dive

Goal:
Understand how data survives, how storage works, and how recovery actually happens in AWS.

What You’ll Learn in Phase 2

*What EBS really is
*Root volume vs additional volumes
*How to attach/detach volumes
*How data persists even if EC2 is terminated
*How snapshots work (backups & recovery)

Here we are going to first 
1.Create a instance
2.Create a volume
3.Attach the Volume  to the instance
4.Format the volume in the instance
5.Mount the instance so that it can be used 
6.Add the volume UUID to the /etc/uuid  so that the volume will be attached to the instance 
  even if the instance is rebooted 
7.Create a snapshot of the volume and create new volume from the snapshot which work as a backup volume managed
  by the AWS
