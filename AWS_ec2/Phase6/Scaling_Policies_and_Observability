Until now :
We have understood that ASG can kill or createa a instance
Application Load Balancer can route the trafffic

But nothing is automatic yet

Here we are going to
*Automatically scale up the instance
*Scale down the instance
*You'll understand who trigger what and why 

CloudWatch Watches -> ASG decides -> Ec2 count changes -> ALB adapts

We are using :
CloudWatch  -> To measure load
Scaling policy -> Rules that tells ASG when to scale
ALB  metrics  ->Traffic based scaling
