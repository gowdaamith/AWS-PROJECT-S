When you "modify " the lauch template only to create a new version 
Nothing changes automatically because AWS protects  running systems  by desing
Only when the ASG  is told to use the  new version do new instance change 

Instance refresh is how a auto scaling group safely replaces OLD Ec2 instances with new one created from the 
Updated launch template -without downtime or without terminating current running instances

When you clikc on Instance refresh : 

ASG -> Instance refresh ->Start instance refresh 

AWS does this cycle ,again and again ,unitl all instances are reaplaced 
1️⃣ Launch NEW instance (using NEW launch template version)
2️⃣ Wait for it to become healthy
3️⃣ Register it with Target Group
4️⃣ ALB starts sending traffic
5️⃣ Terminate ONE old instance
6️⃣ Repeat
Traffic never stops 

While doing the instance refresh we will come across 3 options:
1.What percentage of instances must stay running and healthy All time .This ensure that the percentage of the 
  total number of instances never go below this percent while refreshing the instances 

2.Instance warmUP : How long the AWS  wait  before assuming the new instance is ready to handle the traffic  
During this warmup time  the instance is excluded from scaling decision  and the cpu usage of the instance 
will not be included in the scaling work and termination work 

3.Skip  matching instances: if an existing instance already matches the template - I'll skip it 

When unchecked  it will do : 
*Full replacement 
*Fresh instances
*clean lifecycle 


if you check this :
*Some old instances may survive
*Mixed fleet  = confusion
