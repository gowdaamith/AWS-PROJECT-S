Step 1: Creating the S3 bucket
---------------------------------
1.Go to the AWS console  -> S3 bucket ->  Create bucket

*AWS region -> will be taken as per your current place
  - Data will be replicated across multiple AZ's  in this region 
  - Choose the region closer to you or the customer so you will get (Best latency and cheapest for you )

*Bucket type -> General purpose   -> Strandard S3 bucket ,multi-AZ ,Support all storage class
              |_Directory         -> Single AZ, Ultra-low latency , Higher cost

*Bucket Name -> Global name ,used in URL's and API'S 
              |_ No lowercasee,no space ,cannot change later 

*Copie the setting from the existing bucket  : [Only the configuration not the data ]

*Object ownership 
  - ACL's disable  -> YOur account own's all objects and permission via IAM and bucket policies
  - ACzL's enabled -> Objects in thiis bucket can be owned by other AWS account .Access to this bucket and its 
                      objects can be spcificed using ACL's 
                       if you enable this you will be given two options  will pop up 
                       - Bucker owner preffereed  -> If new objects written to this bucket specify the bucket-owner-full-control canned ACL, they are owned by the bucket owner. Otherwise, they are owned by the object writer.
                       - Object writer  -> the object writer remains the object owner
*Block the public access setting to this bucket ->
  - Here you can directly block all public access 
                      or 
  - allow  some access throught the polices 


  Bucker versioning :
                     |_ disable it -> Only the latest version is stored, delete = gone 
                      |_ enable it  -> Keeps all version's  ,protects against overwrite and delete
                                        - Required for the Object lock and S3 backup and PITR
                                         - Increase the storage cost

Default encryption : 
 - The Encryption applies automatically to all new objects
    SSE-S3 (Amazon S3 managed keys)  - free
    SSE-KMS                           - uses AWS KMS keys  and Extra cost
    DSSE-KMS                          - Dual encryption ,higher security and higher cost

  Bucket key (Only for SSE KMS)
  -------------------------------
  Reduces KMS call's  -> lower cost
Object Lock
Store objects using a write-once-read-many (WORM) model to help you prevent objects from being deleted or overwritten for a fixed amount of time or indefinitely. Object Lock works only in versioned buckets
